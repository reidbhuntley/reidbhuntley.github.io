# Franciscan-Papal Conflict
* Spiritual Franciscans vs. Pope John XXII _(r.1316-1334)_
* John decreed in 1317 that poverty is good, chastity is greater, but _obedience_ (to the pope) is the greatest of all
* He then decreed in 1323 that apostolic poverty is silly, and that if you argue that Jesus and his Apostles didn't own anything, you're a heretic

## Why argue over poverty?
* Lavish, beautiful churches were supposed to teach Christian doctrine and inspire reverence for God's beauty and handiwork

# Jews in Christian Theology
1. According to Christian theology, Jews failed to recognize Jesus Christ as the Messiah. Furthermore, Jews -- NOT the Romans -- murdered Jesus. For this they were to be persecuted.
2. However, Jews also had to be protected, because their conversion to Christianity was a prerequisite for Christ's second coming.

# Jews in the Medieval Economy
1. Canon (Church law) prohibited Christians from lending money with interest to Christians
2. Rulers and Church officials closed most professions to Jews
3. Jews occupied marginal occupations _(undesirable to Christians)_, such as moneylending

* In places like England and France, Jews were the personal property of the monarch, which gave them royal protection but also made them vulnerable to _arbitrary_ taxes when the king needed money.
* Christian resentment at debts owed to Jewish moneylenders and/or th monarch led to mob violence/riots against Jewish communities

# Setting Jews Apart in Cities
* Early Middle Ages -- Jews lived intermingled with Christian neighbors
* Beginning in the 13th century, Christians began demanding that Jews live in separate areas
* This led to the establishment of Jewish __ghettos__ in the 16th century

## Distinguishing Jews by Dress
* Decreed at Fourth Lateran Council (1215)
* Likely borrowed from the Islamic practice of making Jews wear certain colored turbans or sashes
* Pope Innocent III did not give instructions for what a "distinctive habit" was -- _it was not immediately or universally implemented_

# Accusations Against Jews
Christians suggested that the Jews hated Jesus so much that if they had the chance, _they would crucify him all over again_. This led to accusations that Jews ritually desecrated the Eucharistic host.

__Blood libel__ was the accusation that Jews murdered Christian children (and a few adults), in order to obtain blood for the Passover and other rituals. This started in England and was another form of the belief that Jews were responsible for the crucifixion of Christ -- "Jews tortured and murdered Christian children in imitation of Christ's Passion"

# Depiction of Jews in Medieval Art
* Depictions of Jews tell us much more about what medieval Christians thought than what Jews actually looked like
* By the 12thC, the stereotyped image of a Jew was male, bearded, and hat-wearing in a differentiating context -- sometimes they had crooked noses
* Jewish women were viewed more positively because it was believed they had greated potential for conversion

# Leprosy
* _Symptoms_ -- lesions, severe pain, muscle weakness/paralysis, eye problems that may lead to blindness, and _loss of feeling and sensation due to_ __nerve damage__
* _Transmission_ -- close- and long-term contact with nose and mouth fluids from someone with untreated leprosy
* _Treatment_ -- antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs for symptoms

## Leprosaria/Lazar houses
* In 1179, the Church decreed that lepers should be segregated
* A leprosarium could be endowed with Church income, private funds, or managed by a city
* Leprosaria had rules just like monasteries did
* When a leper joined a leprosarium, they were declared to be "_dead unto the world, but alive unto Christ_"
* A leper's "dead living" was to be feared AND admired -- the leper was paying for his sins _in this life_

## Leprosy as Punishment for Sin
* It was commonly believed that _disease and sin were directly related_, and the Church declared that leprosy was divine punishment for lust and other sins
* People thought that lepers were _exceptionally sexual_ because leprosy exhibited similar symptoms to syphilis, a sexually-transmitted infection
* Leprosy was also viewed as similar to _heresy_ -- both were unpredictable and rarely cured
