# The Cult of Saints (cont.)
### Why did the Franks care about saint so much?
1. Instead of burying holy people in cemeteries, the Franks began burying them in churches
2. The elite, especially royals, had themselves buried near saints to ensure _intercession_
3. Monks of the church prayed continuously for the deceased

---
# The Merovingian Legacy
1. Franks fully converted to Latin Christianity and united most of Western Europe $\rightarrow$ __Francia__
2. The Franks sponsored construction of churches + monasteries (soon became centers of learning and _literacy_)

# Decline of the Merovingians
__Mayors of the Palace__ grew more powerful:
1. Manager of the Merovingian royal household (close to the king)
2. Government administrator (understood how the kingdom worked)
3. Acted as a "general" with his own soldiers (military power)
4. Last Merovingian kings were all _very young_ (couldn't fight back against the Mayors)

This position became __hereditary__ in the Pippinid family in the 680s (excluding rival families).

## Charles Martel "The Hammer"
Mayor of the Palace and de facto ruler of Francia (718-741 CE)
* Ousted & eliminated Merovingian family
* Defeated Emir of Cordoba at the Battle of Tours in 732 CE (considered a turning point against Islam in Europe by some?)
* Fought against numerous Germanic enemies
* Suppressed rebellions

# The Carolingians
__Pippin III__ _(r.751-768 CE)_ -- first Carolingian king

## The Franco-papal alliance
* Pope Stephen II crowned Pippin III as King of the Franks -- given __divine authority__
* In return, the Carolingians protected papal interests (e.g. they defended Rome against the Lombards)
    - __Donation of Pippin__ (756 CE) -- land taken from the Lombards & given to the Pope that eventually becomes the Vatican
* Afterwards, popes cited the _(forged)_ __Donation of Constantine__ (700s CE) -- claimed that Emperor Constantine had given Rome over to the Bishop of Rome (the Pope)
    - Used by popes to establish their _authority_ over Rome
    - Not accepted by all at the time

# Charlemagne (r. 768-814 CE)
Crowned __Emperor of the Romans__ by Pope Leo III in 800 CE
1. It gave the Carolingian monarch __divine sanction__
2. It made Pope Leo III an "emperor maker"
3. It was a _direct challenge to Byzantium_, the "new" Roman Empire

Charlemagne consolidates power by defeating:
* The __Lombards__
* The __Saxons__
* The __Avars__ (a non-Germanic people; conquering them triples Charlemagne's treasury)

# The Carolingian Renaissance
__Charlemagne's goals:__ _To unify and standardize a Christian empire_

Monastic standardizations enacted by Charlemagne --

* Monastery rules:
    - _BEFORE:_ Local customs
    - _AFTER:_ St. Benedict's Rule
* Monastery construction:
    - _BEFORE:_ Local customs
    - _AFTER:_ __Cloister__ monks and nuns to safeguard their spirituality
        * Many at first were built as __double monasteries__ (monastery and convent combined), but over time they became more separated
* __Liturgy__ _(a defined set of rituals used during worship)_:
    - _BEFORE_: Local customs
    - _AFTER_: __Roman rite__, now the most common Catholic rite
        * Charlemagne decreed that people should be able to walk into mass and understand what's going on

Kings and nobles patronize monasteries $\leftrightarrow$ Monasteries pray for kings and nobles

# Clerical Education
* _PROBLEM:_ __Clergy__, those ordained for religious duties like priests and bishops, were not prepared for their jobs.
* _SOLUTION?:_ A monk named Alcuin designed a curriculum called the __liberal arts__.
* Consisted of:
    - __Trivium__
        * Grammar _(how to write)_
        * Rhetoric _(how to speak)_
        * Logic _(how to think)_
    - __Quadrivium__
        * Geometry
        * Arithmetic
        * Astronomy/Astrology _(how the stars impacted human life)_
        * Music _(composing music pleasing to God's ear)_

Latin writing was also unified and standardized with __Carolingian miniscule__ (9th century) _(included punctuation, separation between words, NO CURSIVE)_
