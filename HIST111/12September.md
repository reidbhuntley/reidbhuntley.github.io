# The Formation of Islam
## Who Are the Arabs?

* Semitic descendants of __Abraham__ _(Ibrahim)_
* Abraham had children of two different wives
    - Ishmael _(Ismail)_, from whom the Arabs are descended
        * Created the __ka'ba__, initially a polytheistic shrine but became known as the first shrine to God
    - Isaac, father of Jacob, from whom the Children of Israel are descended

## Pre-Islamic Arabian Society
__Bedoins__ -- semi-nomadic desert-dwelling Arabs, who valued...
1. __Tribe__: The basis for Arab social organization; tribe, clan, family, self
2. __Honor__: Keeping one's word, keeping promises
3. __Women's honor__: Women's chastity highly valued; women treated as chattel (property)
4. __Hospitality__: Any visitor is entitled to food and shelter

## Pre-Islamic Arabian Religion
Not much is known about this currently, but archaeology is helping us learn more
1. __Polytheism__: Worshipped many deities associated with nature; believed that desert spirits like _jinn_ caused sandstorms
2. __Henotheism__: Belief in many gods, but that one is supreme; had some sense of the God of Abraham
3. No distinct belief in the afterlife
4. Jewish and Christian tribes migrated into Arabia
    - Christians remained completely within Arab tribal culture

## The Prophet Muhammad (c.570-632 CE)
* Had a troubled childhood
* Became known for being just and trustworthy
* __Khadija__, Muhammad's wife was a key figure
* Recieved a vision from the angel Gabriel during his month of meditation (Ramadan)
    - Recieved this revelation over a number of years
    - Most important belief -- there is _only one god_, Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger
* __Islam__ -- surrender or submission to Allah's will
* __Muslim__ -- one who has performed Islam

## Mecca and Medina
* Muhammad's message was not well-recieved by his tribe, the __Quraysh__.
    - His tribe had control over the ka'ba, an important pilgrimage destination to Muslims
    - They condemned his message of _monotheism_
    - As a result, his message appealed to the disenfranchised
* The city of __Yathrib__ accepted Muhammad's message.
    - He and his followers migrated there in 622 CE; this became known as the __Hijra__
    - Yathrib became known as __Medina__ _("the city of the Prophet")_
    - Marks the start of the Islamic Calendar
* The Muslims fought three battles against the Meccans.
    - In 632 CE Muhammad returned to Mecca to _destroy the idols in the ka'ba_

# The Qur'an
_The word of God and an example of how Muslims should live their lives_
1. The Qur'an was originally an oral text (dictated by Muhammad to his followers)
2. Important themes: monotheism, caring for others, and the __Day of Judgement__ _(if you obey Allah's commands, you'll be rewarded after death)_

# Other Important Sources
* __Hadith__ --  a report about Muhammad's sayings or actions, such as what he did, said, or approved of
    - First component -- a _chain of transmission_ that links the text back to Muhammad
    - Second component -- the text itself handed down in Muhammad's name
* __Sunna__ -- "the way" of the Prophet; the custom or practice of Muhammad's life
    - Muhammad's example is the model for proper Muslim behavior

## Sharia
A _CONCEPT_ for the right way for human behavior in Islam as decreed by Allah, whereby actions are judged as either _lawful_ (halal) or _unlawful_ (haram).

### How do we _discern_ the sharia in Sunni Islam?
1. The Qu'ran
2. The hadith and sunna
3. __Consensus__, based on one of the four different schools of Sunni Islamic law
4. __Analogy__ -- an object might not have existed in the 7th century, but there was something like what we have today, e.g. camels then vs. cars now

## The Five Pillars of Islam
* From the hadith
* Agreed upon by all Sunni and Shi'a Muslims
1. Testification of faith _(public proclamation of devotion to Allah only)_
2. Prayer _(five times a day)_
3. Fasting during Ramadan _(no eating or intercourse from sunup to sundown)_
4. Almsgiving _(giving to charity if you are able to)_
5. Pilgrimage _(the Hajj)_

## Hajj, Pilgrimage to Mecca
* The pilgrimage to Mecca, required of all able-bodied, financially secure Muslims once in a lifetime
* Rites of the pilgrimage established by Muhammad
    - Commemorating events in the life of Abraham, Hagar, and Ishmael
* Everyone treated equally in prayer

# Death of Muhammad (632 CE)
Succession conflicts arose immediately -- chosen not democratically, but by Muhammad's inner circle
1. Abu Bakr (c.573-634 CE): One of the first converts to Islam, was chosen as __Caliph__, literally _successor/political leader_
2. Umar (r.634-644): Assassinated
3. Uthman (r.644-656): Assassinated
