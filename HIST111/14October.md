# Further Mongol Conquest
## Khwarazm
* In 1218, the governor of Otrar massacred a large Mongol trade mission, suspecting they were spies (which was probably true)
* Chinggis then sent an angry diplomatic envoy to the government of Khwarazm, who killed those envoys
* Bukhara and Samarqand surrendered in 1220 -- Sultan Muhammad of Khwarazm was shocked that his two largest and most highly fortified cities fell so quickly

## The Mongols Approach...
Chinggis sent "orders of submission" to foreign rulers. If they submitted and fulfilled certain obligations, he usually let the rulers keep their position.

### Obligations:
1. Pay tribute
2. Periodically visit the khan in person (very burdensome and costly, but you would be treated very well by the khan)
3. Send hostages to the khan (often incorporated into the _keshig_/personal guard)
4. Accept a court supervisor/_darughachi_, who enforced these obligations
5. Provide a detailed map of your kingdom
6. Conduct census and enact new taxes
7. Contribute troops and corvee labor _(unpayed/required labor)_

Usually not all of these were imposed at the same time -- it depended on how you responded.

# Chinggis Khan's Legacy _(Died 1227 CE)_
1. _United_ the Mongols and conquered numerous kingdoms
2. Identifies useful talent, which was often non-Mongol -- for example, an Uyghur created the first Mongolian script
3. Changed population demographics by herding people, such as thousands of craftspeople, across Asia
4. Acceptance of most religions; used it to conquer and govern _(strategic tolerance)_
5. _Jasaq/yasa_ -- A body of laws that applied principally to pastoral nomadic life (original does not survive)

# After Chinggis
* Chinggis had four sons from his wife Borte: Jochi _(probably not actually Chinggis's son)_, Chaghadai, Ogodei, and Tolui
* Chinggis chose Ogodei (r.1229-1241) as his successor (__qaghan/Great Khan__), but he did not leave specific instructions for future choices
* Destructive familial conflicts would occur because of this

# Ogodei Khan
Oversaw the following campaigns:
1. Conquered the Jin Dynasty (very difficult)
2. Raided the Southern Song Dynasty
3. Made Korea submit temporarily
4. Destroyed the Cuman-Qipchaq (Turkic) confederation
5. Conquered the Rus' states
6. Conquered Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan
7. Invaded Poland and Hungary, who were housing Cuman refugees
8. Finished off the son of the Khwarazmian Sultan

# The Golden Horde (Ulus Jochi)
* Existed from 1240s-1502 over former Rus' territory
* Ruled by descendants of Jochi
* The conquest of Rus' was quick, c.1237-1240, because Rus' princes were disunified
* Prince Alexander Nevsky's loyalty to the khans set the stage for the rise of Moscow
* The Orthodox Church always cooperated with Mongol rule, which made it rich because its clergy was exempt for most taxes

# Powerful Mongol Women
Toregene, a wife of Ogodei, was __Great Khatun__ and regent of the Mongol Empire from 1241 until 1246, when she maneuvered for her son Guyuk to be named Great Khan _(he was not who Ogodei nominated)_. The primary sources portray her as highly intelligent, shrewd, and conniving. Guyuk was elected ruled for two years before dying of alcohol poisoning.

__Sorghaghtani Beki__, wife of Tolui (youngest son of Chinggis and Borte), endorses her son Mongke to become khan. This claim was backed up by __Batu__, son of Jochi. Two of her other sons, Qubilai and Hulegu, also later became khans. She was also a Nestorian Christian who patronized places of worship of all religions, and was praised by foreign leaders and authors.

# The Ilkhanate
* Ruled by __Hulegu__ (r.1256-1265 CE)
* Aided by Persian and Chinese siege experts, he conquered the __Nizari Ismailis__ (who followed Shi'a Islam), also known as the Assassins
* Sunni Muslim rulers in the region were happy to see the Assassins fall -- saw them as heretics

## End of the Abbasid Caliphate _(750-1258 CE)_
* Mongol raids forced the Abbasids to begin sending tribute in 1241
* In 1257, Caliph al-Musta'sim refused to submit to Hulegu and visit him in person, who then besieged Baghdad
* In February 1258, the Mongol army spent one week sacking the city and completely destroyed it
* The Caliph was executed honorably (crushed in a carpet)
