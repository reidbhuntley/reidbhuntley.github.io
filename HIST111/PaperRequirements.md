# Source Requirements
* At least TWO primary sources from the syllabus
* At least TWO academic secondary sources (no websites)

# Thesis Statement
* Must have a clear thesis statement/argument -- 
"________ because ________"
* Should have:
    - _Geographical_ bounds -- what area of the world your argument applies to primarily
    - _Temporal_ bounds -- what time period your argument applies to primarily
    - Clear _evaluation criteria_ -- justify in the paper the validity and importance of these criteria
* Anticipate a __counterargument__ by looking at the weakest/most subjective/least relevant part of your thesis

# First Paragraph
The first paragraph should contain your thesis/argument (split up into multiple sentences) and a _road map_ to the rest of your paper. 
* Who will you discuss? When and where?
* What documents will you analyze?
* What is your argument?
* What will your paper look like?
* What events will provide evidence for your argument?

Get __straight to the point__ -- don't hide what the argument is until the end.

First person is ok! Stand behind your argument!
"I argue _____ because _____" _instead of_ "One might argue that _____"

# Academic Secondary Sources
"Academic" sources have been _peer-reviewed by multiple experts_.

## Looking for Secondary Sources
* __umaryland.on.worldcat.org__ -- University Libraries site
* __jstor.org__ -- journals and books that can be downloaded as PDF
* You can look at footnotes and bibliographies of books to find even more sources if necessary

# Citing Sources
* Use _Chicago_ style
* Cite sources using footnotes
* __Cite all direct quotes and any ideas that are not your own!__
* Include page numbers
* Cite a source in full the first time (full name, title, city of publication, page number)
    - Subsequent citations of the same source can be shortened to omit first name and city of publication
