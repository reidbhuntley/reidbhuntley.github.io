# The Mongol Conquest of Southern China
* Took an entire decade for __Qubilai Khan__ _(r.1260-1294)_ to complete
* Southern China had the largest population and the most resources of any of the lands invaded by the Mongols
* Disease and mosquito-infested jungles made movement difficult for horses and people
* The Song had a formidable navy

_How did Qubilai win the war?_
1. Internal Song divisions (last emperors were boys)
2. International help: Chinese, Uyghurs, and Persians advised his army; Chinese, Koreans, and Jurchens built his navy
3. Superior artillery in slow and persistent sieges

# The Yuan Dynasty _(1271-1368)_
The 50 million+ southern Chinese outnumbered the Mongols at least 30 to 1. Qubilai needed to control them, but not oppress them. He created a _four-class system_:
1. The Mongols
2. _Semu ren_: Western and Central Asians
3. _Han ren_: Northern Chinese
4. _Nan ren_: Southern Chinese

Qubilai __Sinicized__ (built a new Mongol capital Daidu/Khanbaliq), but maintained Mongol traditions (_gers_ in palace, seasonal capitals)

# Qubilai and Religion
1. His heir, Crown Prince Jingim (Zhenjin) (d.1286) had Confucian, Daoist, and Buddhist tutors
2. Had Confucian texts translated into Mongolian (for accessibility)
3. Recruited Muslims for bureaucracy; Muslims had their own neighborhoods, governors, and judges
4. Had Daoist leaders perform rituals at court
5. Favored _Tibetan Buddhism_. __Phags-pa lama__ helped Qubilai rule Tibet and created phags-pa script. Buddhist monks were exempt from most taxes.
6. Exempted Nestorian Christian clerics from taxation and conscription

# The Mongols Invade Syria
## _c.1258-1260 (continued on and off until 1323)_

Ilkhan Hulegu was assisted by:
* Seljuks of Rum
* Various Muslim auxiliaries
* King Het'um of Armenia
* Prince Bohemond VI of Antioch & Tripolo

They fought against the __Ayyubids__ in Syria.

However, after Great Khan Mongke's death in 1259, Hulegu withdrew with most of his army to Armenia, leaving one tumen under general __Kitbogha__.

# The Mongols Suffer Defeat
## _The Battle of Ain (Ayn) Jalut, September 3, 1260_

Hulegu sent an embassy to Mamluk Sultan Qutuz (r.1259-1260) demanding submission. Qutuz executed the Mongol envoys, _fully knowing that he was starting a war._

The Mongol forces included defeated Ayyubids, many of whom defected to the Mamluk side during the battle.

At Ain Jalut, Kedbuqa was killed and the Mongol army fled. The battle was the first time the Mongols were defeated AND were not able to avenge their loss.

# Who were the Mamluks?
* _mamluk_ = "slave", property, owned
* mamluks were slaves who recieved an elite military training -- they were trained as cavalry, archers, and the bodyguard of the Sultan
* mamluks recieved an Islamic education and were emancipated (freed) upon completion of training, with the expectation that they'd fight for you
* The mamluk system was __a one generation military caste__; this practice existed since the 9th century

The mamluks were mostly Qipchaqs and a few Circassians. The former were a Turkic, horse-riding people; the latter were a Caucasian people who usually served as palace slaves.

The mamluk system became the __Mamluk Sultanate__ when an Ayyubid sultan bought a group of mamluks and created the Bahriyya regiment. They killed the last Ayyubid sultan in 1250.

# The Mamluk Sultanate _(1250-1517)_
Four of the Bahriyya regiment's five leaders became Mamluk sultans.

* Qutuz of Ain Jalut fame (r.1259-60): probably assassinated by Baybars
* __Baybars__ (r.1260-77): Manner of death disputed
* Qalawun (r.1279-90).

## Problems with the mamluk system
1. It is a one generation system. The children of mamluks were free and tended to make poor sultans.
2. The sultans had to constantly import more mamluks.

# The Mamluks Take Antioch _(1268)_
In 1268, Sultan Baybars took Antioch after a four-day siege. The sultan massacred its and was condemned by Christians and even other Muslims. Antioch as a crusader state had lasted 170 years; Bohemond VI was not in the city to defend it.

# The beginning of the end...
* In August 1290, some Italian troops arrived in Acre and killed a group of unarmed Muslim merchants
* Mamluk Sultan Qalawun demanded that the offenders be turned over to him
* Crusader barons refused to surrender the Italians, knowing they'd be killed
* An unamused Qalaun declared war _(which was probably his plan all along)_

# Siege of Acre _(April 6-May 18, 1291)_

The Mamluks had more than 100 siege engines that pounded the walls for a month 24/7, while sappers dug under tunnels to undermine the walls.

The Templar house held out for another week, but it eventually collapsed, killing attackers and defenders alike.

The Kingdom of Jerusalem had finally ended.
