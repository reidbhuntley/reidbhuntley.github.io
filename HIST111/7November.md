# Knights
What helped create a class of knights with its own _chivalric ideology?_
1. _War and politics_ -- Increasing conflict pushed rulers to surround themselves with soldiers/__milites__ (feudalism)
2. _Religion_ -- the Church tried to regulate _milites_ behavior and reward holy war. (Recall "Peace of God" movement, crusades, etc.)
3. _Technological innovations_ modified the art of war and conferred on knights greater socioeconomic status

# Politics and War in Feudal Society
* Militarization of society in 10th & 11thC strengthened the relationships between lords and their vassals
* Armed service took various forms:
    1. Garrison (defenses) of castles
    2. Participation in pitched battles (exciting but rare)
    3. Sieges and raids (could last months or even years)

## Church concerns about _milites_
1. Moral: _Milites_ disturbed the peace of Christendom
2. Economic: War impacted Church property

In 1054, at the council of Narbonne, the assembled bishops declared that "he who kills a Christian sheds without any doubt the blood of Christ"

_Impact:_ Direct war towards non-Christians.

# Making Knights Holy
* When the Church directed knights to turn their attention towards non-Christians, they helped to _sacralize_ knights -- make them holy
* Military orders formed in the early 12thC _(Templar & Hospitaller)_
    - _Monk-knights_ took monastic vows, but were also excellent _milites_
* Previously most crusaders would just go home after completing pilgrimage on a crusade
* In the Holy Land, the military orders provided a _permanent_ fighting force for the always-outnumbered crusaders

# Technological Innovations
## Horses
* An __equites__ _(knight)_ needed several war-horses in case his horse died, was injured, or fled
* His __squire__ was responsible for bringing him a new horse with minimal delay and caring for the horses
* As defensive armor became heavier, knights needed stronger horses who were trained for close combat
* Improvements in the stirrup and saddle gave knights more stability in battle
## Armor & Weapons
* The quality of armor varied greatly
    - Leather armor, scale armor, chainmail, or plate armor
* Most knights had a sword and carried a lance

# The Cavalry Confrontation
By mid-12thC, a pitched battle commenced with a head-on collision in order to unseat the enemy. A knight had to control the direction of the horse so that the lance hit the enemy head-on. This took a large amount of specific training, especially to work well in tandem with fellow knights.

---
The __knightly class__ formed from the combination of all of these elements:
* Feudal relations
* Sacralization of knights
* Advances in horse breeding
* Technological advances in weaponry
* Cavalry confrontation

These served to separate knights/_equites_ from the __pedites__, the much more common foot soldiers.

# Chivalry
An _ideological_ code of behavior for knights:
* A perfect knight was a courageous and skilled soldier, loyal to his lord and comrades, and merciful to enemies
    - _"A live enemy is more valuable than a dead enemy"_
* He was _appropriately_ (modestly) thirsty for glory
* He was virtuous, courteous and generous
* He honored his lady and defended the Church

This was more of an _ideology_ -- something to _strive for_ -- than something to actually be achieved for the vast majority of knights.

The chivalrous ideology was fostered through _tournaments_ and _romance literature._

__Heraldry__, the system by which coats of arms are depicted and regulated, was an important part of chivalrous ideology (Display of wealth and way to identify enemies/allies)

# Tournaments
* A form of martial (war) game that emerged in late 11thC northern France
* In tournaments, knights practiced riding and fighting techniques to prepare for the cavalry confrontation
    - This required _TEAM training and practice_

## The Melee
* Main event of a tournament
* Fought over several miles of countryside
* Features like rivers and forests provided opportunities for _ambush and sortie_ -- an attack made by troops coming out of a defensive position
* The goal -- __capture the opponent__ in order to ransom them
* Initially, like in real battle, there were no "fouls" or prohibited tactics
* _Melees could be destructive and lethal._
    - Used as a convenient excuse to kill rivals

## The Church and Tournaments
* The Church thought tournaments _promoted sin_ and vices like pride, hatred, and vanity
* Feasts led to gluttony and knights were aroused to lechery as they tried to impress immoral flirtatious women
* The Church tried to ban them, but it was very difficult to enforce and never really worked

## Social Advancement at Tournaments
* Knights at tournaments could forge close bonds between lords and their knights
* A "poor" knight might attract the attention of a wealthy aristocrat and be hired as one of his knights
* A young bachelor might also hope to seduce a rich heiress by wooing her father

---
# Courtly Love
* When military codes of chivalry were extended to include the relationship between men and women, __courtly love__ was born
* A knight owed his lady _obedience and submission_, just like a knight to his lord
* The knight's love for his lady _inspired him to do great deeds_, in order to be worthy of her love
    - He _suffered for her_

## Courtly Love in Romance Literature
Relationships in romance literature were often _adulterous_ because they were idealized relationships that rarely existed within real-life, often non-romantic marriages. _(think Lancelot & Guinevere)_

## Impact on Women
There is little evidence to show that the legal and economic position of women was enhanced by the ideology of courtly love.

The literature of courtly love was not a handbook on how to treat women.
