# Lay Piety / Popular Religion
* _Clergy_ -- those who hold positions in the Church, i.e. priests, bishops; always male
* _Lay people, laity_ -- Christians who are not clergy
* _Lay and popular piety_ -- the religious practices of the _laity_

## Goals of Lay Piety
* Express religious devotion in a meaningful manner
* Connect personally with God
* Modify ideas about gender roles

## The Church's Concerns
* They express piety in a WRONG manner
* They circumvent the clergy's role mediating the relationship between laity and God
* Modifying gender roles could lead to heresy, sin, and religious and social disaster

# Women's Status In Christianity
* The Church taught that God had made men superior to women, and that women should accept their divinely ordained subordination
* Evidenced by humanity's origin story -- Eve clearly demonstrated that women were more prone to sin than men
* The acts that marked women, such as menstruation and childbirth, were viewed as dirty and polluting

## Redeeming Women
* The feminine was not wholly negative, however. The Church was the _bride_ of Christ, who would be redeemed at the end of time [Rev. 19: 6-8]
* _Lay religious movements_ often modified Church ideas about gender roles, which made them popular AND dangerous

# Mysticism in Christianity
Two ways to experience God:
1. Use human intellect and reason to understand the Bible and Christian theology.
2. __Mystics__ sought to experience God _through direct revelation._ They stressed that human reason cannot fully know God.

## Hildegard of Bingen, Mystic _(1098-1179)_
1. Hildegard was an abbess, theologian, composer, nurse, botanist, and scientist
2. She experienced _prophetic and apocalyptic visions_ and dictated them to scribes
3. She was so famous for these that she recieved papal approval to travel and preach -- she went on preaching tours!

# Beguines
* Beguines lived a _"religious life in the world"_
* Single ladies and widows lived together _without a rule or formal vows_ (like nuns did)
* Beguines began to acquire property jointly and live in __beguinages__ (they were often excellend businesswomen)
* The Church disliked beguines because they organized themselves _with little clerical (male) supervision_
* The male equivalent were _beghars_ (although beguines greatly outnumbered them)

# Waldensians
* __Peter (Valdes) Waldo__ _(c.1140-1218)_ was a wealthy French merchant
* Waldo took to a life of wandering poverty and preaching, living on charity, in emulation of Jesus's life on earth

## "Poor" preaching challenged Church authority
1. The Waldensians translated the Bible into __vernacular__, the people's spoken language
2. Waldensians preached publically but _were not ordained priests;_ they relied on charity
3. They argued that the Church's preists were not true priests

_Outcome:_ Waldo disobeyed the pope's order to preach only if they had gained the permission of local clergy -- he and his followers were excommunicated in 1182.

## Other forms of lay piety
* A __penitent__ was a person who repented their sins and sought to atone for them (ideally all Christians were penitents)
    - Some penitents formed groups to atone for _societal_ sins -- they fasted, practiced public flagellation, etc.
* __Anchorites and anchoresses__: "One who has retired from the world" -- a person who withdrew from secular society to lead a prayer-oriented and ascetic life
    - Literally walled up in a one-person cell (usually attached to a church), completely dependent on charity
    - Their prayers were seen as "more effective" by laity
* __Chaste marriage__: A couple who remained married but did not have sex

# The Mendicants: A New Monastic Order
Made up of __friars__ (brothers).
1. Took traditional monastic vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, but they _rejected the monastery's cloister_ in favor of working in cities
2. They rejected wealth and pledged to be personally and _corporately_ (as an order) poor

## The Growth of Cities (12th-mid 14th centuries)
1. Agricultural revolution $\rightarrow$ population increase and surplus product
2. Lords and churches/monasteries attracted merchants and commerce
3. Increased short- and long-distance trade $\rightarrow$ growth of commercial centers, usually along waterways

# The Dominicans
* _Order of Friars Preacher_ (first mendicant order)
* Dominicans were trained as preachers in order to convert heretics _by words_, rather than by the sword
* The order was supposed to be poor -- it had no possessions except churches, and it was to subsist through charitable gifts alone
* As missionaries, Dominicans were especially active in the Middle East and Central Asia -- learned the language of the local people
* Nicknamed _Domini canes_ ("hounds of God") due to their ability as inquisitors

# The Franciscans
* _Order of Friars Minor_ ("little brothers")
* After undergoing a profound conversion experience, the rich Francis cast away his wealth and devoted himself to ministering lepers and outcasts
* The Franciscan ideal was based on the imitation of Christ and his Apostles. _Apostolic poverty_ (the idea that Jesus and his Apostles owned nothing) was the foundation of the Order.

## A Franciscan Dilemma: "How poor should we be?"
* After Francis's death, the Order built the lavish Basillica of St. Francis of Assisi
* _Conventual Franciscans_ argued that the Order could "loosely" interpret Francis's Rule in order to complete their mission
* _Spiritual Franciscans_ argued that the Order should practice Francis's strict vision of poverty in imitation of Christ
