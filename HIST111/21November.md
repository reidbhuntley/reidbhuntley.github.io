# Trans-Saharan Trade
* From the 700s onward, the nomadic __Berber__ peoples (__Imazighen__) of North Africa regularly crossed the Sahara in trade caravans
    - They carried salt _south_ and gold _north_
    - The journey took ~70-90 days
* West African goldfields held one of the largest supplies of gold in the Afro-Eurasian world, and their rulers kept the locations secret
* Other commodities included ivory, copper, glass, slaves, horses, and textiles
* From 13th-late 15thC, the Mali Empire controlled and taxed almost all trade passing through West Africa

## The Dromedary camel
* Trade depended on the camel -- "ship of the desert"
* They could easily withstand hot desert climates and walk over sand
* Could carry 400-500 pounds

## Salt
* West Africa has few naturally occurring deposits of salt
    - The coast has access to sea salt, which does not travel well
    - The Sahara desert contains plenty of rock salt from old lake beds or shallow mines
* Salt is still being harvested from Malian mines and transported by trucks or camel to be refined in the capital Bamako

## West African Gold
* The most productive mines were at the mouths of the Senegal and Niger Rivers
* Men and women mined and sifted rivers for gold

West African gold helped the Fatimids rise to power in the 10thC, formed dinars across the Islamic world, helped Western Europe return to the gold standard in 1252, and decorated 14thC Italian paintings and frescoes.

## Slaves
* In the medieval period, slaves were primarily transported from West Africa to North Africa (Morocco/Egypt) and Arab lands
* Most were women destined for domestic labor and concubinage
* Men worked in caravans, agriculture, mined salt and gold, or became soldiers
* Islamic law required that masters recognize sons born from unions with slave women and grant their mothers freedom
    - Slaves were often freed upon their Muslim master's death as a pious act

# The Griot Tradition
* __Griots__ (_jeliw_) are storytellers, poets, singers, performers, and historians
* Their task is to recreate the past through a live performance
* Griots recited the origins of the "lion prince" __Sunjata Keita__, king of the __Maninka__ people, in the Mande language
* There is no definitive or "correct" version of _Sunjata_; different versions of the epic are often very similar
* In addition to the epic _Sunjata_, most of our records on the Mali Empire are Arabic language sources

# Sunjata
* Sunjata's father (Maghan Kon Fatta) ruled a small kingdom in modern-day Guinea
* Sunjata was born with a congenital leg defect, which saved him when his father's enemies invaded and killed all of Sunjata's siblings, but spared him
* In exile, Sunjata trained with a bow and arrow, strengthened himself by hunting, and gathered a _cavalry_ (which was very rare and expensive to do for this time)
* In 1235, Sunjata returned to his homeland in the valley of the Niger river, eliminated his enemies, and established the Mali Empire

# Mali and Religion
* The Maninka believed in one divine creator god and lesser deities and spirits (henotheism) associated with the elements of nature
* Natural and ancestral spirits could intervene in peoples lives; religious specialists, often called _diviner_, mediated between humanity and supernatural beings

Sunjata and his successors were Sunni Muslims, though they did not Islamize their realm. There is evidence that Sunjata participated in indigenous religious rituals.

## Mali and Islam
* The presence of Muslim merchants from North Africa encouraged Malian _elites_ to convert to Islam, though Muslim Malian rulers continued to engage in indigenous religious rituals
* Arabic was the language of learning and literacy among West African Muslims between the 12th-16thC
* Islamization among peasants was slow and occurred in the 17th-18thC

# Emperor Mansa Musa _(r.1312-1337)_
* Mansa Musa was the grand-nephew of Sunjata
* He went on _Hajj_, pilgrimage to mecca, in 1324-25
    - His caravan consisted of 12,000+ people and 100 camels carrying gold
    - During his three months in Mamluk Cairo, he distributed so much gold that the metal's value declined by 25% on local markets

# Ibn Battuta _(1304-1369)_
Just after Mansa Musa departed Mali, in 1326 the Moroccan Berber and Islamic legal scholar Ibn Battuta went on Hajj to Mecca and Medina.

Ibn Battuta traveled for 29 years, covering about 73,000 miles and 44 modern countries. He wrote the _Rihla_ ("_Voyage_").

He was fascinated by the wealth of Mali, and set off for there in 1351. He criticizes Malian customs, such as the mixing of genders and public nudity.
