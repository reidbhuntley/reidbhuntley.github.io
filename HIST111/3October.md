# Agricultural Revolution (cont.)
Technological changes:
1. _Better tools_:
    - __Heavy plow__ better suited to wetter soils; created furrows
    - __Horse collar__ increased horses' pulling power
    - __Nailed horseshoes__ protected horses' hooves
2. _Better planting_:
    - __Three-field system__ instead of two-field -- allowed for _33% more acres to be planted each year_, decreased the amount of fallow acres that needed to be plowed for weed control

# 6.1 Conclusion
1. The decline of centralized authority in the 9th and 10th centuries led to the rise of feudalism
2. Manorialism _organized agricultural labor_ in the Middle Ages and lasted centuries in continental Europe
3. Between 1000-1300 CE, increased agricultural production aided population growth from ~38 million to 74 million

# Church Reform

## Goals of Church Reform (in the 11th-12th centuries)
1. Limit the laypeople's (non-clergy) influence on Church matters
2. Hold clergy to a high standard of behavior
3. Enforce the vision of a papal monarchy on Christendom

## The Papal Monarchy (in theory)
As eternal salvation was more important than earthly prosperity, the pope argued that ecclesiastical power overshadowed that of nobles, kings, and emperors.

Ideal hierarchy of the papal monarchy:
1. The Pope
2. Bishops, priests, monks
3. Kings, emperors
4. Nobles
5. Everyone else

## The Church in Reality (Lay influence)
* Manorial lords chose parish priests
* Dukes and kings selected bishops, abbots, and abbesses
* Kings and emperors influenced papal elections
    - In the year 1000 -- __no clear, consistent way of selecting a pope__
* Lords expected clergy to _help with administrative tasks_ and _provide warriors from Church estates for feudal armies_
* Many nobles grew accustomed to selling bishoprics and abbacies to unworthy clerics:
    1. A duke seeks a bishop
    2. A candidate buys the bishopric
    3. The bishop exploits tenants to pay for his position

# Immoral Clergy
__Simony__: The purchase of holy things, especially ecclesiastical offices
__Simoniac__: Once who buys an office

* Pope Benedict IX's father purchased his papacy (r. 1032-1048)
* Benedict IX was ousted in favor of Pope Sylvester III (r. 1045)
* A few months later, Benedict ousted Sylvester III, but decided to sell the papacy to his godfather, Pope Gregory VI (r. 1045-1046).
* Then Benedict tried to take it back...
    - In 1046 there were __three papal factions!__

* Reform-minded Holy Roman Emperor Henry III (r. 1039-1056) was shocked at this papal tug-of-war
* Henry III marched into Rome and deposed all three popes; he then appointed the next three popes
* Even though clerics were happy to see the popes gone, some disliked Henry III for taking control of the papacy
* _Simony and clerical corruptions challenged the validity of the __sacraments__._

# The Sacraments
_Ceremonies and rituals that guide Christians through every stage of life_
1. _Baptism_
2. _Confirmation_: Affirm membership in the Church
3. _Matrimony_
4. _Holy orders_: Transformation of a man into a priest who "marries" the Church
5. _Anointing of the sick/last unction_: Preparing the body and soul for death
6. _Penance_: Receiving absolution of one's sins after confessing them to a priest
7. _Eucharist_: The sacrament of Holy Communion, also known as the Lord's Supper

## Should Clergy Be Celibate?
* __Reformers__ believed that sexual activity polluted the moral character of clergy and threatened the efficacy of the sacraments
    - Worried that, if their sacraments were carried out by a corrupt clergyman, then they may not be saved
* __Clerical celibacy__ was difficult to enforce -- there was no Biblical passage requiring priestly celibacy, and most of the apostles were known to be married
* In 1125 CE, the Second Lateran Council ruled that no priest could be married, keep a concubine, or cohabitate with a woman

# Limiting Lay Influence
* _Moderate_ reformers wanted to heal society
* _Radical_ reformers wanted to transform society into a __papal monarchy__...
* ...but many clergy opposed this because they were more connected to local aristocrats by kinship and mutual interests than to a faraway pope
    - The average parish priest _never_ went to Rome or saw the pope in person

# Attempts to Limit Lay Influence
## _Papal Election Decree_
* In 1059, Pope Nicholas II (r. 1059-1061) issued the __Papal Election Decree__
* The pope would be chosed by __cardinals__, who were senior Church leaders and usually ordained bishops
* The issue was that the pope appointed cardinals and the cardinals ellected the pope

## Pope Gregory VII (r. 1073-1085)
* __Lay investiture__ was a ritual in which an emperor or king _invested_ church officials with an office -- bestowed them with authority
* Pope Gregory VII banned it in 1075, angering Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV (r. 1056-1105) and others
* Henry believed that lay investiture was a _God-given right_ -- "I need dependable bishops"
* Gregory believed that bishops appointed by kings would not undertake reforms, and thus jeopardize Christian souls

## The Pope Retaliates
1. In 1076, Pope Gregory VII excommunicated Henry IV
2. Encouraged by Pope Gregory, civil war broke out in Germany (which was easy because Henry was unpopular)
3. In January 1077, Henry crossed the Alps to seek the pope's forgiveness
4. Pope Gregory VII was suspicious, but lifted the excommunication
5. German nobles elected Rudolf of Swabia, Henry's brother-in-law, as __anti-emperor__
6. Henry "deposed" Gregory and elected an anti-pope, Clement III
