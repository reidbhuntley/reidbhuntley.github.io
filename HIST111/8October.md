# Pope Gregory VII vs. HRE Henry IV
* Gregory and Anti-Emperor Rudolf of Swabia vs. Henry and Anti-pope Clement III
* In 1084, Henry chased Gregory out of Rome
* Gregory called the Norman Robert Guiscard (Hauteville) to rescue him, but the ensuing damage to Rome angered the locals
* Gregory died in exile in 1085
* The __investiture conflict__ was formative in the expansion of papal power, but lay rulers continued to exert great influence over Church officials

# Leadup to the First Crusade
## Changing Ideas about War and its Purpose, 10th-11thC
The Church began defining restrictions on the use of force. Known as __jus ad bellum__ -- laws on the right to go to war.
* Why can the Church wage war?
    - To defend the church and those who cannot fight (Peace of God movements)
* Who should wage the Church's wars?
    - All Christians, especially _lay_ lords
* Who should the Church wage war against?
    - Enemies of the Church, such as non-Christians and Christians who attacked other Christians

Result: _War in the interest of the Church -- __HOLY WAR__ -- was worthy of reward_

## The Seljuk Turks
* The __Seljuks__ -- a Turkic people who converted to Sunni Islam in the late 10thC
* Their Sultan was nominally subservient to the Abbasid caliph; however this caliph was mostly a puppet that relied on a Seljuk army
* Most Seljuks settled Syria and Iran -- the __Greak Seljuk Empire__ (1037-1194)
* Some Seljuks invaded Byzantium and captured their Emperor in the __Battle of Manzikert__ (1071)
    - Established the __Seljuk Sultanate of Rum__ (1077-1307)

## The Byzantines Search for Help
* Instability in Constantinople
* Seljuk threat from the East
* Norman threat in the West (in Italy)
* _Result_: Emperor Alexios Komnenos I (r.1081-1118) sent envoys to Pope Urban II at the __Council of Piacenza__ in March 1095:
    1. We need more soldiers to fight the Seljuks
    2. If the pope can help recruit soldiers, we will be nicer to the pope (Great Schism used as bargaining chip)

# The Pope Responds
_Council of Clermont (France), November 1095_
Pope Urban's speech:
1. We need to eliminate the Rum Seljuk threat
2. We should liberate the Christians (primarily Orthodox) in the East under Muslim rule
3. We should __liberate the land of Christ, Jerusalem__ from the Seljuks (this was a suprise)

## Importance of Jerusalem
In addition to Jerusalem's significance in Jesus's life and death, Emperor Constantine built the __Church of the Holy Sepulchre__ ther in the 320s CE to house __relics__.

Jerusalem was an important site for _pilgrimage_ -- the holiest site you could visit. However regular warfare and the Seljuks had made pilgrimage to Jerusalem very difficult, if not often impossible. _(Previously, the ruler of Jerusalem would usually sign peace treaties with neighbors to allow unarmed pilgrims of all religions travel there.)_

Pope Urban was surprised that his speech got such a great response (Deus Vult -- God wills it)

## Pope Urban's Plan
1. __Crusader = Pilgrim__. Just as a pilgrim who traveled to a holy site would, crusaders recieved __absolution__ (forgiveness) of their sins (sacrament) if they reached Jerusalem
2. After __taking the cross__ (public declaration of crusading), participants should sew a red cross onto their cloak
3. In their absence, a participant's belongings would be placed under the protection of the Church
4. If you die in battle, you recieve eternal salvation
5. Everyone leave for Constantinople of August 15, 1096 (the Emperor needed time to prepare to house and feed tens of thousands of pilgrims)
    - Many people ignored this point and left sooner

## Attacks on Jews
* As crusaders and preachers traveled across Germany, some lords began plundering and massacring Jews
* The justification was that Jews had gotten rich from __usury__, lending money to Christians at high rates of interest. _(Many Jews were forced into this profession anyways)_
* "Why should we travel all the way to Jerusalem when we have enemies of the Church right here?"
* Pope Urban condemned these attacks
* Many bishops tried to protect their Jews (saw them as property)

# Arrival in Constantinople
Emperor Alexios I wanted the crusader lords to swear an oath to him to:
1. Promise to be loyal to the emperor in his domains
2. Returned captured lands that had previously belonged to Byzantium

## Three Important Lords
* __Godfrey of Bouillon__
    - arrived December 1096
    - He eventually pledged loyalty to the Emperor, but only after attacking his palace
* __Bohemond of Taranto__, son of Robert Guiscard (Hauteville Norman)
    - arrived April 1097
    - Pledged loyalty to soothe hard feelings, a surprise to many
* The most powerful lord __Raymond IV of Toulouse__ & papal legate __Bishop Adhemar__
    - arrived late April 1097
    - Only sort of pledged loyalty, promised to respect the property and person of the emperor

## A Detour to Edessa
1. A French lord named __Baldwin__ went to find help from Armenian (non-Chalcedonian) Christians in Edessa
2. Through charisma and intrigue, Baldwin became _Count of Edessa_ in 1098, breaking his oath to Emperor Alexios!
    - _This set the precedent for crusader lords taking cities as their own!_

# Siege of Antioch
### Oct. 1097 - June 1098
1. Winter, 1097-98: Went VERY POORLY (hunger, starvation, and disease for the pilgrims)
2. February, 1098: Things get EVEN WORSE
    - The Shi'a Fatimids take Jerusalem from the Sunni Seljuks
    - Displaced Seljuks march north to support their hold on Antioch
3. June, 1098: GOOD. Someone betrays the city to Bohemond the Norman.
4. BAD: Seljuks besiege the crusaders in Antioch (besiegers become the besieged!)
5. WORSE: Some crusaders outside the city tell the approaching Byzantine army coming to save the crusaders that all is lost, so Emperor Alexios turns around
    * The starving crusaders inside Antioch see this and angrily take back their oath to Alexios
6. BETTER: Inside a church in Antioch, someone "discovers" the __Holy Lance__, which reputedly pierced Jesus's side during his crucifixion -- rallies the crusaders
7. VICTORY against the Seljuks on June 28, 1098
