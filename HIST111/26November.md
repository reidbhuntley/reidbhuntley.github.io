# Italy & the Holy Roman Empire
_How did the Holy Roman Empire come to rule northern Italy?_
* 774 CE -- Charlemagne conquered the Lombards
* 800 CE -- Charlemagne crowned Holy Roman Emperor (HRE)
* 888 CE -- Carolingian Empire disintegrates; Italy left alone for a while
* 961 CE -- HRE Otto I conquered the Kingdom of Italy

---
# Northern Italy -- _c.961-1100 CE_
* Between 961 and 1100 CE, the HRE was generally an absentee ruler
* __Communes (city-states)__ in northern Italy began electing an executive body of _urban nobles_ to rule over them
    - (Remember that the Normans began conquering southern Italy around 1000 CE, so the situation there is much more complicated.)

## Urban Nobles
* Nobility was characterized by land ownership, age of family status, and office-holding
* Urban nobles demonstrated their wealth by building houses with fortresses and towers in cities

During the 12th century, _cities_ grew in importance because:
1. They attracted merchants and commerce
2. Noble families wanted to participate in the increasingly powerful Church

This is what drew nobles away from their rural villas and into the cities.

## Italian Communes and Trade
Communes developed trade networks across the Mediterranean by innovating financial and legal institutions _that the HRE was neglecting._

Trade requires mechanisms for issuing __credit__ _(trust)_, protecting contracts, ensuring delivery, settling disputes, etc.

One of the most important northern Italian economic innovations was the __commenda__ -- contract for pooling capital and sharing risks and rewards of overseas commerce.

# HRE vs. the Lombard League
Angry at commune independence, HRE Frederick Barbarossa (r.1155-1190) imposted officials called __potestae__ to administer justice and collect taxes.

Resentment of HRE rule led to formation of pro-papal __Guelf Lombard League__ in 1167. The __Ghibelline__ faction were those who still supported the HRE.

The Lombard League defeated Barbarossa in battle in 1776 (serious resistance). The resulting __Treaty of Constance__ (1183) _allowed the communes certain freedoms if they acknowledged imperial overlordship._

# The Sovereign Italian _City-State_

1. A city-state was headed by a __podesta__ elected by a city's governing council made up mostly of _magnates_ (noble landowners)
2. He was usually a _foreigner_ (could still be from a different region of Italy) so that he'd be impartial in faction conflicts
3. His duties included dispensing justice, presiding over city meetings, and leading armies in war
4. He brought his own portable government including judges, notaries, and a bodyguard
5. He and his crew usually served for 6-12 months _(so they can't be influenced/bribed as easily)_

## Social and political classes
1. _Podesta_
2. Magnates
    - Urban nobles and magnates dominated city councils
3. _Popolo_
    - In early 13thC, the _popolo_/"people" began demanding greater political power
    - The _popolo_ was the "middle class": skilled workers, artisans, merchants, and professionals like notaries
    - They begain electing their own leader (__captain__) and ran their own courts
    - _Popolo_ captains then gained representation on city councils
4. Peasants, serfs, unskilled laborers
    - Formed most of the population, had no representation

---
## Growing _popolo_ power
1. By the 1280s, the _popolo_ controlled city councils and passed laws that disadvantaged magnates
2. In some cities, street brawls between magnates and the _popolo_ turned into civil war
3. In other city states, the _popolo_ forced out the _podesta_, who was viewed as a tool of the magnate
4. _Popolo_ success led to division and they split into factions: the modest _minuto_ (artisans, shopkeepers) and the wealthier _grasso_ (bankers, merchants)

---
## Guilds
Most _popolo_ were members of __guilds__ (_arti_), self-regulating associations of craft masters and professionals.
1. Regulated apprenticeships and training
2. Regulated working conditions and wages
3. Regulated quality and prices of goods
4. Regulated relations with political authorities
5. Performed charity

---
## Rise of the _signori_ _(c.1300 CE)_
* Factionalism, oligarchy, and violence led to the accession of __signori__ -- regimes dominated by one man, often called despots
* A _signori_ usually rose when one faction would gain power and extend the term of executive for life
    - They would then eliminate opposition by exiling their opponents
* Rule by _signori_ sometimes became dynastic, with rulership passing from father to son

---
City-states _do not_ develop in the south, for a variety of reasons:
* Much more distance between cities
* Less densely populated
* Travel is more difficult due to terrain
