# The Roman Empire

Key aspects:
1. Patriarchal & class-based (rich were powerful, poor/slaves had little power)
2. Public entertainment was important part of society
3. Religion was a part of daily life for everyone (regardless of class)

## Roman Religion
* Greek gods readapted to Roman culture
* Public, religious, __civic__ _(for the good of the city)_ ceremonies held at temples
* __Syncretic__ _(mixed, open to foreign influences i.e. Egypt)_
* From c.42 BCE, the imperial cult started worshipping emperors -- they became __deified__ _(made divine)_ upon death

## Jews in the Roman Empire
* Had to pay taxes to practice Judaism
* Usually small community, not usually seen as threatening
* Central belief -- God elected the Jewish people for a relationship (__covenant__) structured by laws and practices
    - A __messiah__ will return to lead Jews in a time of peace
* __70 CE:__ Romans destroyed the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem after a rebellion

---
# Christianity in the Roman Empire
* Central belief -- Jesus, son of God, ascended to heaven after being crucified (c.30-36 CE) to reconcile humanity and God
    - Believed that he would return to earth _soon_ __(within the lifetime of his followers)__
* Disliked by Romans because:
    1. Didn't venerate Roman emperors/practice in civic rituals -- treasonous
    2. Belief that Jesus would return = belief in the end of the world = end of the Roman Empire
    3. Ritual of the Last Supper was considered cannibalistic
        - Bread = body, wine = blood (metaphorically)

## Appeal of Christianity
1. Easy to remember one divinity
2. Some deified emperors were disliked by the public
3. Poor Romans were overburdened by taxes to temples
4. _All_ people, regardless of class, had access to Christian teachings and rewards

Some Roman emperors persecuted/scapegoated Christians.
_Ex._ Nero blamed the Christians for starting fires throughout Rome

## Rise of Christianity
__Emperor Constantine__ _(r. 306-337 CE)_: Ordered soldiers to paint the symbols "chi" and "rho" (first two letters of _Christos_ in Greek) at the __Battle of Milvian Bridge__; won the battle afterwards
* 313 CE: Constantine proclaims __Edict of Milan__, which legalized Christianity (10-15% of Romans were Christians at the time)

## Challenging Christianities
Many versions of Christiany existed at the time claiming different things about God, Jesus, and their relationship

## Arian Christianity/Arianism
__Arius of Alexandria__ _(256-336 CE)_ taught:
1. God was uncreated. _(uncontrovertial)_
2. God created Jesus, therefore Jesus is inferior. _(controvertial)_
3. The three persons of the Trinity are utterly different from each other. _(controvertial)_
    - God > Jesus > Holy Spirit

Arianism had many followers, unlike other offshoots which were more "fringe".

### Council of Nicaea, 325 CE:
* GOAL: __Doctrinal unity__
* SIGNIFICANCE: First __ecumenical__ (church-wide) decision that claimed "universal" authority
* LEGACY: __Nicene Creed__
    - God = Jesus = Holy 
* RESULT: Arius and his followers were exiled.

## "Barbarians" Challenge Rome
* __"Barbarians"__: Foreigner, non-Latin speaker, __nomadic__ (no cities, "uncivilized")
* Huns set off a chain reaction -- attacked Germanic tribes, forcing them westward into Rome
* Germanic culture emphasized _comitatus_, the bond between a warrior and his lord
* Germanic women had more rights/freedom than Roman women
* Mixed systems of agriculture & pastoralism

### Germanic Tribes
* __Visigoths__ ("West Goths")
    - Led by their chief Alaric;
    - Underpaid, underappreciated Visigoth soldiers in the Roman army sacked Rome in 410 CE ("controlled sack" -- meant to send a message)
* The __Vandals__
    - Sacked and plundered Rome in 455 CE after the Roman emperor murdered his best general, a Vandal
    - "Uncontrolled sack"
    - Origin of word "vandalism"

## "Fall" of the Roman Empire, 476 CE
In 285 CE, Roman Empire split into two administrative regions (West and East).
Causes of decline in the West:
1. Shift of political power from Rome to Constantinople (the "New Rome")
2. Invasions by Germanic tribes + internal conflict
3. In 476 CE, a Germanic soldier named Odoacer (an Ostrogoth) deposed the Western Roman Emperor
    - Ostrogoths would rule Italy for the next three and a half centuries
