## An Attempt At Peace
* People of Constantinople made plans to offer the city _peacefully_ to Lord Boniface
* They don't know that crusade leaders had signed a treaty that if the city fell, the emperor would be _elected by a council_ of Franks and Venetians AFTER distributing the city's plunder

## The Sack of Constantinople (April 13, 1204)
* Crusaders incentivized to pick the city clean
    - They did so so horrifically that Pope Innocent III was SHOCKED
* Under Latin rule, Constantinople was now immediately at war with Byzantine nobles
* In 2001, Pope John Paul II issued an apology to the Greek Orthodox Church about the incident

# A New Crusade Target -- _Heretics_
* In the Middle Ages, __heresy__ was often perceived to be more dangerous than non-Christian religions -- heretics hid in plain sight and actively sought to lead others to sin

# Catharism
* __Catharism__ -- saw the universe as a battleground between Light and Dark, God and Lucifer, who created the material world _(believed they were __equals__)_
    - Widely followed in Occitania/Languedoc (southern France)
    - Believed the material world was inherently evil
    - Goal: Free oneself from the material world through the ritual of __consolamentum__, which:
        * _Baptized and cleansed_ the recipient of sin
        * _Ordained_ the recipient as a __"Good Man/Woman"__, a "priest" who performed Cathar rituals
    - Good Men and Women were celibate, did not eat meat and eggs (difficult life)
    - Most Cathars were __"Believers"__, those who had not yet recieved the _consolamentum_ (often recieved the ritual on their deathbead)

## Cathar Beliefs
* Cathars accepted _Jesus as God, but not man_
* Argued that the birth and resurrection of the body was a cruel joke -- why would God want to be born into an evil material world?
* Believed that Lucifer/Satan/Evil One created the Church, who had perverted Jesus's message

## Languedoc
Why did Catharism flourish here?
1. It was a politically fractious area.
2. Bishops and abbots (and lords) resented papal interference.

# Fighting Heresy
* Pope Innocent III sent legates to southern France to:
    - Reform the local church
    - Preach the Gospel
    - Engage in public debates with heretics
* Count __Raymond VI of Toulose__ _(1156-1222)_ -- refused to fight Catharism in his territory and was excommunicated in 1207 (often accused of being a Cathar, but this is unknown)
    - Sought forgiveness from the papal legate Peter, but they got in a fight
    - The next morning Peter was assassinated by Raymond's knights _(no evidence that Raymond himself ordered this)_

# The Albigensian Crusade _(1208-1229)_
* March 1208 -- Pope Innocent III denounced Raymond of Toulouse as a murderer and heretic
* The French who marched on Languedoc would recieved priveleges associated with a crusade to Jerusalem
* However, a crusader to Languedoc fulfilled his vow after 40 days of military service

## Raymond VI's Response
* Raymond VI "pleaded guilty" to supporting heretics. In June 1209 he was publicly flogged and absolved
* Raymond then joined the crusade marching against his realm!
    - _He wanted to ensure that the crusade did not cross into his lands_, and he would also be able to turn the crusaders against his political enemies specifically.

## The First Victories _(1209)_
* Beziers and Carcassonne were the first major targets; thousands were killed
* _"Kill them all. God will know his own."_

## Major Crusader Players
* Count __Simon IV of Montfort__ _(1165-1218)_ was named leader of the crusadee. He faced angry lords...
* ...such as __King Peter II of Aragon__ _(r.1196-1213)_, lord of the dead viscount of Beziers and Carcassonne
* Raymond VI abandoned the crusade quickly and appealed to Peter II for help
    - Peter had had great success against Muslims in Iberia

## The Battle of Muret _(September 12, 1213)_
* Simon vs. Peter & Raymond
* Raymond survived, but Peter -- "defender of Christendom" -- was killed

# The Fourth Lateran Council
* Pope Innocent III and the council declared:
    - Raymond VI was guilty of aiding heretics _(again)_
    - Simon of Montfort would keep lands he conquered
    - Another crusade to Jerusalem (#5)
* As a result, Simon lost nearly all potential recruits, who preferred to fight for the holiest place in Christendom rather than Languedoc

## Raymond VI and son Raymond VII
* Cities like Toulouse welcomed Raymond VI and his son Raymond VII back to lead rebellions
* Simon was extracting huge taxes from his citizens
* Citizens _didn't care_ that Raymond VI was accused of aiding heretics -- they saw Simon and his crusaders as __foreign invaders__ with a __completely different culture__
* Simon attacked Toulouse many times but couldn't capture it; he was killed in June 1218 by a rock

## The Crusade Drags On...
* Raymond VII was reconciled to the Church in 1222
* He negotiated a peace treaty with King Louis IX of France in 1229
* _Two decades of crusade failed to destroy Catharism._
* _It took __Dominican inquisitors__ a century to wipe out the heresy._

# Fourth Lateran Council _(cont.)_
* Trained as a lawyer, __Pope Innocent III__ _(r.1198-1216)_ believed that he stood between God and man as the represetative of Christ
    - Comes closest to enforcing the vision of _papal monarchy_
* __Council's goal:__ Reform the church and motivate a crusade to recover Jerusalem, lost since 1189.

## Some Important Canons
* __1.__ __Transubstantiation__: The bread and wine used in the sacrament of the Eucharist becomes _in reality_ the body and blood of Christ
    - Only at mass and only when performed by an ordained priest
    - Had been believed for a while, but here it was first enshrined in law
* __21.__ Every Christian must confess their sins to their priest once a year, and must recieve the Eucharist at Easter
    - Concern that some Christians were not being pious frequently enough
* __66.__ Priests cannot accept money for sacraments
* __68.__ Jews and Muslims under Christian rule must wear _distinguishing_ dress
    - Did not describe what the dress was -- wanted kings to enforce the rule _(many of whom did not)_
