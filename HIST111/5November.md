# Medieval Education
## Monastic Schools
* In rural areas, children might be educated at a monastery or convent
* Some children were dedicated as __oblates__ -- children whose parents intended them to become monks or nuns
* Students were educated in the __liberal arts__, the Bible, and how to pray
* (Rich enough families would usually hire tutors to come to their house and teach their children instead)

## Cathedral Schools
* In cities, some men studied at cathedral schools under _master_ teachers
* Afterwards they usually had two options:
    1. Become a cleric who knew the Bible and could read and sing music
    2. Become a professional scribe and/or notary
* There has been at least one cathedral school in Paris since the 10th century

# Universities
## Different Types of Universities
1. Some developed under strong Church direction, such as Paris (theology)
2. Some were organized by students, such as Bologna (law)
3. Others were supported by civic (Siena) or imperial (Oxford) power

All the universities discussed today were _studium generale_, well-regarded schools that attracted international students who studied under _masters._

## Bologna _(est. 1088 CE)_
* Originally, __university__ referred to a specific group of students
* At Bologna, the "universities" worked with the city to obtain rights for the students, such as reasonable food prices and rent. They also established rules for professors.
    - This made Bologna unique -- it was governed by a corporation of students!

## Paris _(est. 1150-1170 CE)_
* In contrast to Bologna, Paris was a _university of the masters_ (teachers)
* Around 1200, Parisian masters began to work to:
    1. Obtain priveleges that would protect them and students from bullying bishops and city authorities
    2. _Standardize_ education -- issue consistent syllabi, curricula, and exam procedures
* Pope Innocent III gave funds to U.Paris.

## Oxford _(est. c.1168 CE)_
* Oxford was established by a migration of English students from Paris
* Similarly, it was governed by masters
* In contrast, university privileges in Oxford were _granted by the king rather than the pope_

## Cambridge _(est. 1209 CE)_
* In 1209, a conflict between students and people of Oxford caused a migration of students to Cambridge
* University "_chests_" -- scholarships and housing -- were established to assist needy students
    - Students also lived in _residence halls_
* _Colleges_ were semi-autonomous communities of students. They were organized according to origin, socioeconomic status, and grades.

## Salerno _(est. as early as 9thC CE)_
* Medieval medicine was based primarily on Greek physician Galen's __humoral theory__.
* Human health requires an equilibrium between the four main bodily fluids, or __humors__ -- blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm.
* Doctors prescribed remedies to restore the body's humoral balance
* Medieval Christian medicine was supplemented by Islamic and Jewish knowledge

# General Uni Characteristics
* _Curriculum_ -- the list of books students had to read to obtain a degree in a particular subject
* _Lecture_ -- lecture
* Students studying theology would participate in public _disputations_
* After taking _exams_, you could recieve one of three degrees:
    1. _Bachelor's_: Teach under supervision of master at the university
    2. _Master's_: Teach on your own at the university
    3. _Doctorate_: Awarded after public exam by jury of masters; teach at any _studium generale_

# Student Life
* Students participated in races, long-jump contests, croquet, lawn-bowling, simplified tennis, swimming, early forms of ice hockey and soccer, and free-for-all fights pitting students from one region against those from another.

    - Bologna tolerated private gambling, such as dice in dorm rooms, but not public gambling.

    - At Montpelier, students were allowed to play dice as long as losses remained under two cents and didn't distract studies.

* _Universities attempted to regulate student drinking_ because riots often started in taverns.
    - For example, Bologna restricted drinking to certain days, while the University of Paris set a drinking curfew.
