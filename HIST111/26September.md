# The Normans in Italy

* ...until the Norman __Willian "Iron Arm" of Hauteville__ conquered Apulia from the Byzantines in 1042.
* The Hautevilles took Sicily from Islamic rule (which took _thirty years_) and played pivotal roles in the First Crusade

## The Normans vs. the Pope
* In response to William "Iron Arm"'s victory, Pope Leo IX raised an army and marched against Apulia.
* The Normans defeated the pope at the __Battle of Civitate__ (1053).
* Thereafter the papacy generally supported the Normans because they were Latin Christians, who could push back the Orthodox Church in Italy and Muslims in Sicily.

## The Normans vs. Byzantium
* Robert Guiscard (Hauteville) defeated Byzantine __Emperor Alexios I Komnenos__ at Durazzo (1081) and at Corfu (1084).
* Though Robert's son __Bohemond__ lost these cities soon after, _the Byzantines would ALWAYS dislike the ormans._
