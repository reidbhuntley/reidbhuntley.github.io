Debates about the nature of Christianity took place in the __Eastern Roman/Byzantine Empire__:

# Latin (Nicene) Christianity
* The human Jesus -- born on Earth to Mary (also a human), and is also divine (God made flesh)
* The divine Jesus is also human
* __Hypostases__ -- two natures in one person

# Debates on the Nature of Christ (Competing Christianities)

## Nestorian Christianity (The Church of the East)
* __Nestorius__, Patriarch of Constantinople (428-431 CE)
* Taught that _human_ and _divine_ natures of Jesus are separate
* Thought that Nicene Christianity de-emphasized Jesus's humanity too much, and that Jesus could act according to his own will
* Called Mary the "mother of Jesus" as opposed to "mother of God"
* He was excommunicated at the __Council of Ephesus__ in 431 CE
    - Claimed that his enemies didn't understand his teachings

## Miaphysitism
* c.449 CE -- the monk __Eutyches__ claimed that Jesus's human nature was _absorbed_ into his divine nature
* Has one mixed (divine AND human) nature vs. two separate natures
* __Miaphysitism__ -- Greek for "one united nature"
* His enemies accused him of teaching __monophysitism__ -- Greek for "one _single_ nature" (divine nature only)

## Council of Chalcedon, 451 CE
* Formed in response to the miaphysite issue
* Decreed that Jesus has _two natures in one person, divine and human_
* Called the __Chalcedonian position__
* Eutyches was then excommunicated
* Today -- Catholic, Orthodox, and almost all Protestant churches accept it
    - __Non-Chalcedonian__ churches known as "Oriental Orthodox"

---
# Oriental Orthodoxy
* c.301-314 CE -- Armenia adopts Christianity as a state religion
* 325 CE -- Nicene Creed
* c.330 CE -- Ethiopia adopts Christianity as a state religion (non-Chalcedonian)
* 451 CE -- Council of Chalcedon

# Christianity in Ethiopia
## Kingdom of Askum (c.100-c.940 CE)
* __King Ezana__ (r.320s-c.360 CE)
    - Converted to Christianity and made it the Aksumite state religion
* __Frumentius__ was appointed the first bishop of Aksum
* 520 CE -- Aksumite __King Kaleb__ invaded Yemen to end persecution of Christians there by King Yusuf Asar of the Himyarites, a Jewish Arabic tribe

# Debates Over Papal Power
## Council of Chalcedon
* __Constantinople__
    - "New Rome"
    - Patriarch
* __Rome__
    - "Old Rome"
    - Pope
* Chalcedon argued that the patriarch of Constantinople should have equal power to the Pope
    - The Pope rejected this argument

## How Did the Pope Become the Pope?
* After Jesus's death, Christians were lead by __bishops__ _("overseers")_
    - Ordained members of the clergy in charge of __dioceses__
* __Patriarchs__ -- bishops of especially important cities who had authority over bishops
    - Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem, Constantinople, and Rome.
    - Chosen for importance in Jesus's life, and for their political and geographical purposes
* _Note:_ Alexandria had their first bishop in 42 CE; Rome had its first in 67 CE.

### Over centuries, and with help.
* __Biblical justification__:
    - 382 CE -- bishop of Rome claimed supremacy over the other four cities based on the authority of St. Peter _("keys of the kingdom of heaven")_
* __Legal justification__:
    - c.450 CE -- the pope decreed the __Doctrine of the apostolic see__
    - Stated that as Peter's successor, every bishop of Rome had the full authority of this position
    - Claimed to link every pope in a continuous line from Peter
* __Royal justification__:
    - 8th century -- __Franco-papal alliance__ mean the pope crowned the Carolingians as kings, and recieved protection in return

# Iconoclasm -- A battle over images
* __Icon__: Representation of a holy person or religions image
    - Often painted on wood and portable
    - Helped teach theology and morality
* 8th century Byzantium -- __iconoclasts__ began accusing iconophiles of __idolatry__ _(worshipping the icons themselves instead of what they depicted)_
* __Iconoclasm__ --  Greek for "image-breaking"
    - Periods when religious imagery was forbidden and destroyed at _imperial command_
    - Emperor decided how religious symbols would be interpreted
* Two periods of iconoclasm in Byzantium -- 8th century and early 9th century
* Officially ended as imperial policy in 842 CE
* The Pope always supported the use of icons -- another point of conflict between the two churches

## More Latin-Orthodox Conflict
* Also clashed over __clerical celibacy__ and the use of yeast in bread for the Eucharist
* Rulers in south Italy & Constantinople were forcing their church's practices over the people living in their territory which caused the conflict
* As a result, papal legates excommunicated the Patriarch of Constantinople in 1054; the Patriarch in turn excommunicated those legates
* Known as __the Great Schism (East-West Schism) of 1054 CE__

# Conclusion
1. Christian doctrine has been redifined & clarified many times, often in response to theological challenges
2. Papal power developed over centuries; Constantinople would always dispute it
3. Latin-Orthodox split became a bargaining chip in East-West relations _(ex. Byzantines making religious concessions to the pope in exchange for military support)_
