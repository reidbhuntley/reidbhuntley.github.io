* Extreme climate w/ strong winds, long winters, brief summers, and unreliable precipitation
* Only 1% arable land, 8-10% forested land
* __Ger__ -- Mongolian word for yurt

## Nomadic Pastoralism
Life on the steppe prepared herders to be excellent soldiers
* The Mongols were __nomadic pastoralists__, who _seasonally_ herded their animals to find better pasture
* Most important animal: the __horse__ (transportation, war, sign of wealth, used for milk)
    - Oxen & yaks, Bactrian camels, sheep, goats were also herded
* These animals are all adapted for feeding on open range, in very cold weather, and with low water needs

# Pre-Imperial Mongolia
For most of the 12th century, the Mongols were just one of numerous clans in northeastern Mongolia.

__Temujin (Chinggis)__ _(c.1162-1227)_ was from the Borjigid clan, and had a difficult childhood after his father, a minor khan, was poisoned by a rival Tatar tribe (according to _The Secret History_)

## The Rise of Temujin
1. Ability to attract more powerful allies
    - Temujin's _blood brother_ __Jamugha__ (Mongol) and ally __Toghril Khan__ (Kereyid) helped him rescue his wife __Borte__ from her Merkid kidnappers in 1184 CE
2. Ruthlessness
    - Temujin decimated the Tatars in 1202 to avenge the murder of his father
3. Ability to overcome challenges
    - Both Toghril Khan and Jamugha betrayed Temujin, but he was able to defeat the Kereyid tribe in 1203
4. Ability to identify talent
    - Temujin understood his weaknesses (in both military and administration) -- he rewarded skill and expertise, like general Jebe "the Arrow"
5. Military prowess and adaptability

# Chinggis _(Genghis)_ Khan
* As Temujin conquered rival tribes, he attracted more and more supporters
* In 1206, Mongol chief gathered at a __quriltai__ to endorse Temujin as their ruler and enthrone him as _Chinggis Khan_

# The Mongol Art of War
* A __tumen__ of 10,000 units was divided into units of 1,000, then 100, then 10; each unit had a commander
* Chinggis personally chose the commander of _tumens_ based on military skill and loyalty -- this helped supersede old tribal lines
* Chinggis's personal guard, the __keshig__, was recruited from the families of _tumen_ commanders and submitted rulers
    - They could be used as hostages in case their fathers rebelled

## Basic Principles
1. Get the enemy to move first. Break their formation.
2. Counter-attack.
3. Inflict casualties as enemy flees.

## Tactics
The Mongols were usually outnumbered, so devising a successful set of tactics was important.

The most famous tactic used was the _"feigned retreat"_ tactic -- they fled and made themselves look small to draw the enemy out (which could last up to a week), then turned around and attacked their front while a hidden force attacked their flank.

## More Principles
1. Cavalry and archery prowess: Mobility a force multiplier, composite bow
2. Assimilate new capabilities: e.g. siege warfare vs. Jin Dynasty
3. Discipline, discipline, discipline: Hunting (_nerge_) was practice for war; if you retreated without and order, you were punished or executed
4. Intelligence gathering: Merchant spies, postal stations called _yams_
5. Psychological warfare: Pretend retreat, massacre to obtain capitulation
