_Medievalism_ - Devotion to/adoption of medieval ideals, practices, events, & imagery.

Example: __Joan of Arc__ - seen today by different groups as
- a symbol of white, heterosexual French people
- a champion for LGBTQ rights
- the patron saint of French soldiers (Catholic Church)

No debate over what happened in history, but over what it __stands for__ -- how it's recontextualized in modern times. (Medieval symbols used as __ideological weaponry__)

Another example: __The Crusades__ - used by both white supremacist groups & ISIS/Daesh to explain why things are the way they are today.
