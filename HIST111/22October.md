# England and Normandy
## After 1066
* Anglo-Norman kings split their time between England and their continental lands
* William the Conqueror -- King of England, but still Duke of Normandy _(as a __vassal__ of the King of France)_

# King John I of England _(r.1199-1216)_
* Son of Eleanor of Aquitaine _(very wealthy)_, brother of Richard the Lionhearted
* West coast of France all belonged to England as fiefs
    - The king would often spend time there and was seen as an absentee by English barons
1. After John fought with his cousin Arthur in Brittany, Arthur disappeared -- rumors spread that John had him murdered
2. King Philip II of France _(r.1180-1223)_ invaded John's French lands and took Anjou and Normandy in 1204
3. John was broke and without a home in France, so he returned to England permanently; Anglo-Norman nobles lost much of their weath

# John vs. Pope Innocent III
* Pope Innocent III wanted to elect Stephen Langton as Archbishop of Canterbury
* King John declared his right to lay investiture and seized the cathedral of Canterbury
* In response, Innocent laid an __interdict__ on all of England in 1208 (pause of the sacraments; less harsh than excommunication) and excommunicated John in 1209
* In 1213, when John learned that Innocent was encouraging Philip II of France to invade England, __John agreed to become Innocent's vassal__

## Battle of Bouvines _(July 27, 1214)_
1. Philip II of France defeated John, who forced his Anglo-Norman nobles to forfeit their remaining French lands
    - He refused to let the nobles be vassals to both kings, which in turn forced them give up their fiefs held by Philip II
2. Barons revolted against King John in the spring of 1215. In June, the barons forced John to sign the Magna Carta at Runnymede

# Magna Carta -- "The Great Charter"
GOALS:
1. To limit the "money-getting" activities of the king and his agents.
2. To make royal justice more equitable and available.
3. To assert that _the king could not act against individuals in an arbitrary fashion_ ("by will").

In effect, __the king was subject to the law.__

NOTABLE CLAUSES:
* __39 and 40:__ The King promised not to act against free men except by judgement of their peers or by the law of the land, and never to sell, delay, or deny justice.
* __"Security clause":__ John was forced to authorize a committee of 25 barons to enforce the charter's terms -- _even against himself_

# What Led to the Charter? 
## _Financial Difficulties_
- The king's revenues derived from his feudal rights, the profits of justice, the royal forest, and from the king's own lands
- The king also took revenue (loans) from Jews, since _Jews were the king's property_
    - Christians could not loan money with interest to other Christians, so Jews were forced into becoming money-lenders
- As a result of excessive revenue extraction, many Christians ended up owing their Jewish debts to the crown, increasing Christian-Jewish tension and resentment towards the king
* This led to:
    1. Terrible inflation in early 1200s
    2. Loss of Normandy $\rightarrow$ increasing exploitation of England

John was so successful at exploiting England that his annual revenue was over 1/3 larger between 1208 and 1212 than it had been at the start of the reign.

The Charter responded to this by limiting wardship inheritance tax.

## _Desire for Regular Justice_
* Justice for the Barons
    * English kings swore to dispense justice and maintain the rights of the crown
    * Barons were angry that John had dispossessed some of them _"without lawful judgement of their peers"_
* Royal Justice for the Masses
    * In cases of unlawful dispossession, everyone (except serfs) was entitled to a _trial by jury before royal justices_
    * King John closed the royal court at Westminster and insisted that all cases should follow his own travels around the country

The Charter responded by having the royal court held at a fixed place, and demanding that the king cannot dispossess someone (take their land) without lawful judgement of their peers.

## _King John was a Jerk_
1. King John's arbitrary justice rewarded friends and punished enemies
2. John drove the baron William Longespee (his half-brother) into rebellion by seducing his wife
3. John's feud with another baron, William de Braose, was concluded by murder: William's wife Matilda and his eldest son were starved to death in Windsor castle

# The 1215 Magna Carta Failed.
* King John asked his _lord_ Pope Innocent III to "veto" the Charter, which he did
    - Even he thought the Security Clause went too far
* In 1216 the barons invited Prince Louis VIII of France (son of Philip II) to take the English throne
* John died unexpectedly on October 16, 1216 after battling with his own barons
* The rebellious barons made peace with the new king, John's nine-year-old son Henry III
* In Nov. 1216 a new Magna Carta was issued _with the Security Clause omitted_.
